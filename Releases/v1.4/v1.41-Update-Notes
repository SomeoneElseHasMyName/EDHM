Very minor update to fix the cabin lighting turning off unexpectedly. 

If you already have v1.4 installed, you only need to replace the Custom.ini file 
in the EDHM-ini folder (which is in the elite-dangerous-64 folder)

You may download the v1.41 Custom.ini here:

If you wish to take a selfie of your CMDR, turn off the coloured cabin lighting
with SHIFT F1
