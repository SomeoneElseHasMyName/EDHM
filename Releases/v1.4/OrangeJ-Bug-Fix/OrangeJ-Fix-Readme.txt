In EDHM v1.32 we discovered the Orange J bug fix reduced FPS and / or caused video stuttering for some CMDRs (not all).

Many mod users did not read the notes about the potential FPS issues with the fix, and proceeded to complain about the mod.

Since removing the Orange J bug fix from the mod I have received zero legitimate complaints about FPS drops.

Therefore, I have decided not to include the Orange J bug fix on Github.

If you would like the Orange J bug fix for EDHM v1.41 please make a request via Discord and I will send it to you directly.
