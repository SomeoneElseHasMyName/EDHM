This fix is included in the v1.4 Instructions PDF

There is a bug in VR with the External Camera lighting fix. 

The fix turns off the coloured lighting when in external camera mode to prevent the colours from contaminating the CMDRs skin or flight suit. 

However, when sitting in a station the fix can also turn off the coloured lighting unexpectedly.

To disable the fix, please open Custom.ini (in the EDHM-ini folder, which is in the elite-dangerous-64 folder) with a text editor.
Comment out (insert a semi-colon ; ) in front of the line x110 = 1 so that it looks like this:

Then save the file. That will fix the bug.

When you use the external camera, I suggest pressing SHIFT F1 to disable the mod so you can take nice selfies of your CMDR.

Please note, this only affects the VR version and does not appear to affect the pancake 2D version.
