Once you're familiar with the default profiles EDHM v1.4 has to offer (cycle through the profiles with CTRL F1),
you may wish to make your own profile (combination of colours), or even a profile for each ship!

I've created an online tool to assist with making a profile:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRQnzGfILQ4opnC5dJujnYdmgUIIIRdScAGmUspTiOo/edit?usp=sharing

Follow the Instructions in that document carefully and you will be able to create as many profiles as you like.

If you have any questions about using the EDHM Profile Tool, you're welcome to contact me:
