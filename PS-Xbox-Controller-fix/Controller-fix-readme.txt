Some CMDRs have reported their PS or Xbox controller doesn't work with the mod.

This only occurs when Steam overlay is activated and managing the controller (the mod is not compatible with Steam overlay)

There are two fixes:

i. Force Steam to not manage the controller
ii. Load Elite without Steam

Both fixes are explained in this folder.

It's probably easiest to try option i. first

Please note: Not everyone experiences a conflict between their controller and the mod
