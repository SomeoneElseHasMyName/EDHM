There are many CMDRs running into issues using their PS/Xbox controller with EDHM.

I'm quite sure it's because they have linked or are using their controller through Steam, 
and the Steam overlay isn't compatible with the modding software, 3Dmigoto (though not in all cases).

To get Elite to load without Steam, go into the Elite installation folder, right-click EDLaunch.exe and select "send to desktop" (create a shortcut)

My EDLaunch.exe file is located here, but yours might be different:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous\EDLaunch.exe



Next, go to the desktop and right-click on the shortcut you just created, and go to properties, then the 'target' box, and add the setting /novr onto the end 
(the flag means "don't use VR"). 

So for my shortcut target I have:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous\EDLaunch.exe" /novr

and in the 'Start In' box I have:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous"



When I want to run Elite in VR I use a second shortcut, with the target:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous\EDLaunch.exe" /vr



Then make sure Steam is closed and isn't running in the taskbar, double-click the new shortcut, and hopefully Elite loads without Steam.

On the first run you might need to log into the Elite launcher with your Frontier account details, but I only had to do that once.
